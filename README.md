I developed an Amazon clone with the intention of gaining a deeper understanding of React.js and its capabilities. This project allowed me to explore various aspects of React, such as its component-based architecture, state management, and user interface development, while replicating the core features and functionality of the Amazon website. Through this hands-on experience, I was able to enhance my skills and knowledge in web development using React.js, a popular and powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
